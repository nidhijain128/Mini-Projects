I have submitted following 5 files along with readme:
	createdb.sql
	populate.java
	hw2.java
	dropdb.sql
	sdoapi.jar

For execution - 	
	1) Run createdb.sql to create Database tables, indexes and metadata entries.
	2) Place the jar files along with these files in the same folder. I have used sdoapi.jar also so please copy that from my folder as well, otherwise the code will give errors. The .xy files, image file, .jar and .zip should also be placed in the same folder as the .java files.
	3) Compile populate.java - Command for compiling this file will be 
		javac -classpath .;classes111.jar populate.java 
	4) Run populate.java - Command for running this file will be 
		java -classpath .;classes111.jar populate buildings.xy students.xy announcementSystems.xy
	5) Compile hw2.java - Command for compiling this file will be 
		javac -classpath .;classes111.jar;sdoapi.jar;sdoapi.zip hw2.java
	  Two notes will be displayed on command prompt window. The can be ignored.
	4) Run populate.java - Command for running this file will be 
		java -classpath .;classes111.jar;sdoapi.jar;sdoapi.zip hw2
	5) Run dropdb.sql ror removing all the database tables, indexes and other entries created.

Sometimes, it takes few seconds for the feature types to load.
